### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for almost everything. I consider that is a good practice to check with MDN even I have grabbed a solution or an example somewhere else.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - You get what you ask here. And answers might be from another planet, fact-checking help a lot.
